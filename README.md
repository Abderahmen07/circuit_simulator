# Angular Electronic Circuit Simulator

Welcome to the Angular Electronic Circuit Simulator project! This web application provides a user-friendly graphical interface for designing and visualizing electronic circuits. Please note that circuit resolution is not yet implemented.

## Current Features

- **Intuitive Graphical Interface:** Use a user-friendly interface to create and edit electronic circuits.
- **Real-time Visualization:** Get an immediate visual representation of your circuit as you build it.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Node.js and Angular CLI installed. Run the following command to install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
2. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   ng serve
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:4200/ to use the application.

Next Steps
While the graphical interface is operational, circuit resolution is not yet implemented. Next steps for the project include adding features such as automatic circuit resolution and displaying results.
